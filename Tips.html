                                <p>Recycling conserves natural resources, reduces pollution and saves energy.
                                    Recycling involves sorting and cleaning up trash to produce "secondary materials"
                                    — mainly glass, paper, metal and plastic — for reuse in products. Recycled aluminum,
                                    for example, is a particularly valuable resource; manufacturing using recycled
                                    aluminum is
                                    92% more efficient than when unused raw materials are used, according to the
                                    Aluminum Association.
                                    About 40% of the country's aluminum supply comes from recycling, but we are still
                                    throwing away nearly
                                    $1 billion worth of aluminum cans that could have been recycled every year.</p>

                                <p>Plastic bags pose ecological problems. They take hundreds of years to decompose and
                                    pose
                                    a particular threat to wildlife. Hundreds of thousands of marine mammals die every
                                    year after mistaking
                                    plastic bags, which are laced with chemicals, for food. Many animals get entangled
                                    in plastic bags and suffocate.
                                    A sound approach to retail bags is to decline them when your purchase is otherwise
                                    carriable or bring your own bags.
                                    Use and reuse all those bags — paper, plastic, cloth — that have been accumulating
                                    in the closet over the years
                                    — whether or not they are designed to be "reusable." If they become too grubby to
                                    carry your new purchases,
                                    use them to line waste cans or for picking up litter. And, ultimately, dispose of
                                    them properly
                                    — recycle them if you can.</p>

                            <p>The waste landfills are bulked up with consumer product packaging. Containers and packaging made up the largest portion 
                                of municipal waste at almost 78 million tons, or nearly 30%, according to the EPA. Slightly more than a third gets recycled, 
                                but huge amounts end up in landfills. Packaging also adds significantly to both the cost and carbon footprint of consumer products.

                                When it's not possible to avoid packaging, reuse containers, polystyrene (styrofoam) fillers, and bubble wrap, or see if 
                                your local shipping service can use them. The third best alternative, after reducing and reusing, is recycling. </p>

                                <p>Humans are huge consumers of cars, food, furnishings, household products, recreational
                                    equipment, and electronics —
                                    and we buy much more than we need with many of our consumer purchases getting very
                                    little use.
                                    Excessive personal consumption of goods means higher direct and indirect costs to the
                                    environment,
                                    including the energy used and pollution emitted in the extraction of natural resources,
                                    and in the manufacturing, transportation, and disposal of goods.
                                    These costs can be substantially reduced by avoiding impulse buying and making a
                                    realistic assessment
                                    of need before making a purchase. When you do have to buy goods, find durable
                                    alternatives with the smallest amount
                                    of packaging and the lowest possible carbon footprint and keep them in good repair.</p>

                                <p>Britains consumed 9.7 billion gallons of bottled water in 2017, beating carbonated drinks for a second year in a row. 
                                    Though British's tap drinking water supplies are generally clean and have to meet EPA standards for potability, 
                                    it's the convenience of bottled water that makes it so popular. And consumption continues to 
                                    grow as consumers move away from sugary drinks in pursuit of better health and still use bottled water 
                                    to the detriment of environmental health.
                                    According to researchers from the Pacific Institute in Oakland, California,
                                     energy required to produce, transport, and chill bottled water requires up to 2,000 times the energy 
                                     required to produce tap water. In addition, plastic bottles can take 450 years or more to decompose.
                                      So, yes, drink plenty of water for good health, but use a reusable water bottle or simply a glass as you pour water from your ta.</p>

                                <p>You will reduce your carbon footprint if you limit the amount of meat and dairy you consume. Animal-derived food production has a much higher
                                     greenhouse gas output than grain and vegetable production because of the highly inefficient transfer of plant energy to animal energy.
                                     Depending on how it's measured, animal-based agriculture is responsible for about 15% of all worldwide GHG emissions, according to the
                                      Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.


                                    You don't need to become a vegetarian or a vegan to reduce your foodprint. By eating chicken instead of beef for one year,
                                     you will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 882 pounds, and by having just one vegetarian meal a week you could save the GHG equivalent 
                                     of driving 1,160 miles, according to the Center of Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan.</p>

                                    Eating locally-grown food also saves energy because of the lower transportation costs.

                                <p>While great strides have been made to reduce tailpipe emissions — 99% since the 1960s — we are driving more than ever. 
                                    There are more cars on the road than there are licensed drivers, and each vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.

                                    Whenever you avoid getting into your car, you are doing the environment a favor. Walk or bike when you can, and use public 
                                    transportation where you can't. Find companionable people who make the same routine trips you do and form a carpool. 
                                    Rather than taking short trips to do your errands, combine your trips, thereby reducing mileage and avoiding a number of cold starts.</p>

                                <p>Growing organic food is labor intensive but requires 30%-50% less energy to produce.

                                    Eating locally-grown food also saves energy because of the lower transportation costs. 
                                    Eating all locally-grown food for one year could save the GHG equivalent
                                     of driving 1,000 miles, according to the Center of Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan.</p>

                                <p>Nearly 30% of the waste stream consists of food and yard waste, according to the EPA. Over 50 million tons go to a landfill or incinerator. 
                                    Composting not only saves disposal costs — and reduces the methane emitted from landfills — but it also creates a valuable soil amendment,
                                     reducing the need for manufactured fertilizers. You don't need to have a lot of land or technology to compost your household food and yard waste, 
                                     so long as you follow a 
                                    simple formula and keep meat, bones and dairy products out of the mix.</p>
